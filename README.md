## Overview

`sport` is an R package with the research compendium of the GIPSO’s
biological rhythms and sports systematic quantitative literature review.
The aim of `sport` is to facilitate the research work, in addition to
contributing to the reproducibility of the research.

The assemble of this package was inspired by Ben Marwick, Carl Boettiger
& Lincoln Mullen’s article [“Packaging Data Analytical Work Reproducibly
Using R (and Friends)”](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986).

## Installation

You can install `sport` from GitHub with:
