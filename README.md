`sport` is an R package with the research compendium of the GIPSO’s
biological rhythms and sports systematic quantitative literature review.
The aim of `sport` is to facilitate the research work, in addition to
contributing to the reproducibility of the research.

The assemble of this package was inspired by Ben Marwick, Carl Boettiger
& Lincoln Mullen’s article [“Packaging Data Analytical Work Reproducibly
Using R (and Friends)”](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986).

[here](https://www.griffith.edu.au/griffith-sciences/school-environment-science/research/systematic-quantitative-literature-review).

## Installation

`sport` is still at the
[experimental](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
stage of development. That means people can use the package and provide
feedback, but it comes with no promises for long term stability.

You can install `sport` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("gipso/sport")
```

## Citation

If you use `sport` in your research, please consider citing it. We put a
lot of work to build and maintain a free and open-source R package. You
can find the `sport` citation below.
